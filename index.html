      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        My name is, as the page says, Hayat White. I am a very curious person who like to explore and understand. I work hard as I am
        an avid learner and enjoy expanding my understanding. This attitude has pushed me in various directions and I have been
        fortunate enough to study these passions and make a career from the skills I have developed.<br><br>
        I am a graduate from California State University, Chico with a Masters of Science in Computer Science. I received my Bachelors 
        in Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics as well during my time at Chico State. Before this, I attended Butte Community College to pursue
        and obtain Associate degrees in Computer Science, Physics and Mathematics. <br><br>
        Since May of 2025, I have been working at Oregrown in Chico as a Contracted Software Engineer. During this time, I have been able to gain
        experience and demostrate my technical abilities in the design, development and implementation processes while working with Python.<br><br>
