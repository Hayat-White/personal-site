      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Brief intro. What you work on, what you’re interested in, and what
        someone should know after landing here.<br>
        My name is, as the page says, Hayat White. I am a very curious person who like to explore and understand. I like to work hard because I
        like to see what I can really do. This attitude has pushed me in varying directions throughout my life, but I have been
        fortunate enough to be able to study various passions and make a career from the skills I have developed.<br>
        I am a graduate from California State University, Chico with a Masters of science in Computer Science. I received my Bachelors 
        also from Chico State, in Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics. Before this, I attended Butte Community College to pursue
        and obtain Associate degrees in Computer Science, Physics and Mathematics. <br>
        I have been working at Oregrown in Chico as a Contracted Software Engineer since May of 2025. During this period, I have been able to increase
        technical abilities in the design, development and implementation processes while working with Python.
